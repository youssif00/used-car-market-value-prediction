# used-car-market-value-prediction
The used car market is a dynamic and complex industry with constantly fluctuating prices influenced by various factors such as the car's make, model, age, mileage, and other attributes. In recent years, machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), have shown promising results in predicting used car prices. This essay aims to explore and compare the effectiveness of these ML models in accurately predicting the market value of used cars based on various features.

To develop robust predictive models, a diverse dataset comprising used cars with their associated attributes, such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, and historical transaction prices, must be collected. The dataset may also include additional information like the car's condition, location, and other relevant factors that could impact the car's value. Proper data preprocessing, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and categorical variable encoding, is crucial to ensure optimal model performance.

To assess the performance of each ML model, the dataset needs to be split into training and testing sets, ensuring the models are evaluated on unseen data. Common evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) can be used to quantify prediction accuracy. Through rigorous evaluation, the strengths and weaknesses of each model can be identified, helping to select the most suitable approach for used car market value prediction.
